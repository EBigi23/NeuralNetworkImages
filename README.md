# Neural Network for Images

## Project Overview
This project focuses on advanced image analysis using a U-Net-based convolutional neural network (CNN). The primary objectives are image segmentation and image processing. The project utilizes the CIFAR-10 dataset, traditionally used for image classification, but adapted for segmentation and image enhancement tasks.

## Project Objectives
1. **Image Segmentation:** The main goal is to develop a model capable of accurately segmenting objects or regions within images from background or other regions.

2. **Image Processing:** The project involves image processing tasks, including Gaussian blurring and the addition of Gaussian noise to training images, to improve image quality and enhance robustness.

3. **Model Optimization:** The U-Net model is optimized for efficient convergence and performance.

4. **Data Handling:** The project includes data preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, and managing data augmentation.

## Model Details
- The U-Net architecture is utilized, consisting of an encoder and decoder with skip connections.
- The model uses specific hyperparameters such as the number of convolutional layers, activation functions (ReLU and sigmoid), and optimization techniques (Adam optimizer).
- Loss is computed using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) function, and accuracy is used as a metric for evaluation.

## Training and Validation
- The model is trained and validated on appropriately divided datasets.
- Callbacks are employed to monitor training and adjust learning rates for optimal convergence.
- Trained models are saved and loaded for future use.
